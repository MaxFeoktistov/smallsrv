     The  Small  HTTP  server  ver 3.06 support separate language file. This
give  possibility to make any localisation of the program. The language file
named  'shs_lang.cfg'.  The  file  is  the  same  for  Windows and for Linux
versions.  If  this  file  is  placed  in  the  same  directory where placed
configuration  file,  the  program load strings from this file. Localisation
files that are already available, placed into 'langpacks' directory.
     If  the  file for your language is not precent there, then you can make
it yourself, just translate the file from some other language. If you do it,
then you  may  send  me the result, it will be including in the next packages
and it will be a vailable for download on the site.

shs_lang.cfg file format:

     It  is  text  file. The file including the records for strings constant
that using the program. Each record it is:

MNEMOTIC_NAME=some text<LF><LF>

     (<LF>  --  mean new line) The records separated by empty line. The text
into  the  record  may  be  multiline,  but  all new line characters will be
removed   when   loading.  To  insert  new  line  in  the  string  use  '\n'
construction.  Also  if you would like to include backslash in the text then
use two backslash '\\' instead. Another interpreted char it is \r, \",\' .
     Some  strings  used for format output. In these strings the % sign must
be replaced to %% (two procent sing).
     Some  string  include  HTML  formatting  and  in some case HTTP header.
Please,  be  careful,  do  not  change  this  parts of string, otherwise the
program will not work correct.

And very importing record it is:

charset=; charset=windows-1250

     There  you may direct the charset that will be using. If the charset is
utf-8 the Windows version of the program will try to convert the strings for
dialog-windows to unicode.
